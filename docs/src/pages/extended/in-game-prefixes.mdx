# In-Game-Prefixes

Prefix requirement with optional permission flag

With this feature, you may optionally require a prefix to be prefixed in front of the message for it to send to the relay server, on top of that, you may also require a flag to use that prefix

Use cases:

* Admin broadcast, with prefixes and admin only flags, you can have a cross-entities channel for in-game admin broadcast

To enable:

1. Set `rf_scr_prefix` to something not empty in `Source-Chat-Relay.cfg`
2. Optionally, you may set a letter flag for `rf_scr_flag` to restrict the prefix usage
